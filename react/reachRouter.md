# reach router

import {Router} from "@reach/router";

- order doesn't matter it has it's own scoring system based on specificity
- you can have multiple routers

```js
<pre>
    <code>{JSON.stringify(props, null, 4)}</code>
</pre>
```
- stringifies what you get from the reach router - see how props and state are changing all the time 
- also can see this in props
